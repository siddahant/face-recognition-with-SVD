# face-recognition-with-SVD
The purpose of this exercise to explore the connection between the singular value decomposition
(SVD) and face recognition. The file contains the images of 38 different faces with 64 different
lighting scenarios in which we will use the first 36 faces to train our algorithm on and the last two
to demonstrate its potential
